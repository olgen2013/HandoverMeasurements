Handover Measurements in Mobile Communication Systems
====================



Abstract of the seminar paper


This seminar paper provides a summary of han-
dover measurements for packet oriented mobile data services
between different radio access technologies (inter-RAT handover)
in a field trial. This includes measurements between third- (3G)
and second-generation (2G) mobile telephony communication
standards for data communication like Long Term Evolution
(LTE) and its predecessors Evolved High Speed Packet Access
(HSPA+), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS),
Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) and General
packet radio service (GPRS). The project goal was to measure
handover-related data transmission failures respectively han-
dover interruption times. The measurements were collected in the
network of the german mobile network operator T-mobile within
different locations by using a WebSocket connection between
the mobile device and a server. The results show that shorter
interruption times could be expected for a handover between
UMTS/HSPA+ and GPRS/EDGE than between LTE and UMTS-
/HSPA+. The interruption time caused by an inter-RAT handover
event were around 4.5 (LTE → UMTS/HSPA+, packet size 120 &
1412 bytes), 3.67 (UMTS/HSPA+ ↔ GPRS/EDGE, packet size 120
bytes) and 3.0 seconds (UMTS/HSPA+ ↔ GPRS/EDGE, packet
size 1412 bytes).
